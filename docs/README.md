# @fakehost

A collection of resources for UI development. Fake out your REST, and WebSocket services, 
control them from your tests (Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress) to provide deep level of testing, including edge-cases, reconnection, error throwing. 

Bundle your fake services as part of storybook, or a demo app. 

Build the ui against a fake version of the real api, while a backend developer builds the real service.

Use contract tests to ensure your fakes matches, and continues to match the real remote service.
