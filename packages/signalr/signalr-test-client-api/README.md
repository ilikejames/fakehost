# @fakehost/signalr-test-client-api

This is the generated typescript client api of the `signalr-test-dotnet-svc`. 

`signalr-test-dotnet-svc` is a real dotnet signalr service, which uses 
[TypedSignalR](https://github.com/nenoNaninu/TypedSignalR.Client.TypeScript) typescript code generation to create a typed client interface for calling the remote. 

The generated code would not normally be committed. But it is in this case to avoid dotnet setup unless necessary.
