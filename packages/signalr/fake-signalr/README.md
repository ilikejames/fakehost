[![NPM Version][npm-image]][npm-url]

A fake version of the Signalr protocol. 

**[See the docs for more info.](https://ilikejames.github.io/fakehost/#/fake-signalr/)**


- can be run as a localhost service, or bundled within a web browser. 
- used for testing client side ui code deeply against a known (fake) backend 
- contract tests to ensure the fake matches the remote
- supports JSON and message pack wire protocols

Best place to look is the at the [test fake service](https://github.com/ilikejames/fakehost/tree/master/packages/signalr/signalr-test-fake-svc/src)

##Â Tests

As `@fakehost/signalr` is a fake version of a real dotnet signalr service.

1. There is a real signalr server `signalr-test-dotnet-svc`. This is a real dotnet signalr service. 
We use a typescript client generation tool `TypedSignalR` to generate a typescript client library for 
calling this remote service. This generate code is outputted to `signalr-test-client-api`

2. There is a fake implementation of the hubs from the dotnet service `signalr-test-dotnet-svc` in the 
`signalr-test-fake-svc`. This is a nodejs fake implementations of the real dotnet services. 

3. Along with the fake implementation in `signalr-test-fake-svc` there are **contract tests** for each hub.
These contract tests run against the fakes (`yarn test`) and are also run against the real dotnet service
(`yarn test:contract`). This ensures that fake version has the exact same behaviour as the real dotnet service, and as such:

**The @fakehost/signalr behaves identically to a real dotnet signalr service**
