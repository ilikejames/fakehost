# @fakehost/exchange

Documentation coming soon.

Gives 3 types of fake host:

1. `InlineFakeHost` for bundling directly in a browser. This works by mocking out the websocket.
2. `WsFakeHost` a W3C compliant websocket service for running in node.
3. `SockJSFakeHost` a sockjs service as some clients require this.
